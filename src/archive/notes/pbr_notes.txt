    BxDF
        f(wo, wi)
            It returns the value of the distribution function for the given pair of directions
            doesn't work for delta distributions
        Sample_f(wo, wi, sample, *pdf, *sampledtype)
            computes the direction of incident light wi given an outgoing direction wo and returns the value of the BxDF for the pair of directions
            Handles delta distributions
            sample & pdf are only used for non-delta
